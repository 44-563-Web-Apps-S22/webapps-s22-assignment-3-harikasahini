<p>I am an ambitious girl whose world revolves around myself.I always love to travel and explore places.
   This is the first time ever I moved away from my home to pursue Master's in United States which is 8000 miles away from my home country.
   Although I miss my family, I feel amazed about the progress in my career.

<h3>Favourite Movie- Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</h3>
<p>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a holiday classic.
   It is agreat movie, and it’s a lot of fun to watch Kevin McCallister (Macauley Culkin) try to survive the holiday season on his own.
   It was always been an eye feast to watch the drama sequences and hilarious comedy for me.
